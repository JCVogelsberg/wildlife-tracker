== Wildlife Tracker

* The Forest Service is considering a proposal from a timber company to clear-cut an old-growth forest of virgin redwood just outside of Portland. Before they give the go-ahead, they need to do an environmental impact study. They've asked you and your pair to build an app so that the rangers can report wildlife sightings.

* Start out by letting users CRUD/L (create, read, update, destroy, list) species.
* Next, allow them to input a sighting of an animal, along with the date, time, and location. (Hint: a species has many sightings.) Add CRUD functionality for these sightings.
